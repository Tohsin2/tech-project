The first tech project i did was in wed development and specifically frontend web

It was overwhelming at first because i had zero knowlegde about tech and i started the class febuary 2022

It was an interesting journey because now am getting better and improving my skills and working on every chance i get to improve and get a job in a tech organization.

Today am writing my first repository in git and am so happy to be doing this
